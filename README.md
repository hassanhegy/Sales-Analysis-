🚀 New Power BI — Sales Analysis Dashboard

Pleased to share a dashboard I built to surface actionable sales insights at a glance. Highlights include:

KPI overview: Total Sales, Orders, Quantity, Profit

Breakdown by Category → Sub-Category → Product (treemap + bar chart)

Geo analysis by city (interactive map)

Clean, filterable UX with Date / Customer / Product drill-downs

Data model: Product, Customer, Date dims + centralized measures (DAX)

Built a production-ready Power BI dashboard to track sales performance end-to-end:

Fact table (Sales) + dims (Product, Customer, Date)

DAX measures for sales, profit, orders, quantity and advanced filtering

Visuals: KPI cards, treemap by Category/Sub-Category/Product, horizontal bars for sub-category, and a city scatter map for geo insights
